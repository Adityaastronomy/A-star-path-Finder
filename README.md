A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
This project is a visual implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm using Pygame. The algorithm finds the shortest path between a start point and an endpoint on a grid, considering obstacles that can be manually placed by the user.

Features
Interactive Grid: Click to place the start, end, and barriers on the grid.
A Algorithm*: Uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.
Visualization: Watch how the algorithm explores the grid and finds the path.
Real-time Interaction: Modify the grid dynamically and rerun the algorithm.
Reset Functionality: Clear the grid and start over easily.
How to Use
Start the Program: Run the main.py file.
Place the Start and End Points:
Left-click on any grid cell to place the start point (orange).
Left-click on another grid cell to place the endpoint (turquoise).
Place Barriers:
Left-click on any other grid cell to create barriers (black).
Run the Algorithm:
Press the Spacebar to start the pathfinding process.
The algorithm will visualize the path (purple) as it is found.
Reset the Grid:
Press the C key to clear the grid and start over.
Right-click on any grid cell to reset it individually.
