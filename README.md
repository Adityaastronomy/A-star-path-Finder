#### A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
This project is a visual implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm using Pygame. The algorithm finds the shortest path between a start point and an endpoint on a grid, considering obstacles that can be manually placed by the user.

## Features 
Interactive Grid: Click to place the start, end, and barriers on the grid.
 1. A Algorithm*: Uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.
 2. Visualization: Watch how the algorithm explores the grid and finds the path.
 3. Real-time Interaction: Modify the grid dynamically and rerun the algorithm.
 4. Reset Functionality: Clear the grid and start over easily.

## How to Use
-> Start the Program: Run the main.py file.
-> Place the Start and End Points:
   -Left-click on any grid cell to place the start point (orange).
   -Left-click on another grid cell to place the endpoint (turquoise).
-> Place Barriers:
   -Left-click on any other grid cell to create barriers (black).
-> Run the Algorithm:
   -Press the Spacebar to start the pathfinding process.
   -The algorithm will visualize the path (purple) as it is found.
-> Reset the Grid:
   -Press the C key to clear the grid and start over.
   -Right-click on any grid cell to reset it individually.
